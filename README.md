# DependencyInjectionExample
Simple example of a couple of uses of dependency injection illustrating the IoC principle
This code provides an example of dependency injection by method and by constructor.  
It includes a thread-safe singleton pattern for the debug log object.
Instead of using a DI/IoC framework (creating yet another project dependency), the principle
is applied directly and simply.

Unit tests are provided and work, testing the debug log and the SystemInfo example.

The code shown herein was written from scratch in less than a weekend.
